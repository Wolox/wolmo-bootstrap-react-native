### Bootstrap Kick off

For bootstraping your own project using the template generator script you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Run `yarn install`.
2. run `yo yourPathToWolmo/generators/app/index.js` you'll need [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/learning/index.html) installed for this. Also, the argument `-v` can be used for logging.
3. Some prompts will pop up on your terminal. Pick whatever configuration works best for your current proyect.
4. After the script is finished, your project folder will be successfully generated with all the necessary yarn dependencies installed. Do `cd you/project/path`.
5. Start budler using `yarn start`.
6. Run `npx react-native run-ios --scheme qa` or `yarn ios` for iOS and `npx react-native run-android --variant=qaDebug` or `yarn android` for Android.
7. Start working on your project!

### How do you have to configure Bitrise?

You will have to complete the [`bitriseInfo.json`](/generators/bitrise/bitriseInfo.json) with the next Info:

```
    "repositoryUrlSsh": "", // What's your repository url? (ssh only)
    "publicApp": false, // If true then the app visibility setting will be public, in case of false it will be private (boolean value)
    "repositorySlug": "", // Write the repo slug (The name of your repo not the url)
    "repoOwner": "", // Who is the owner of the repo?
    "gitProvider": "", // The git provider you are using, it can be 'github', 'bitbucket', 'gitlab', 'gitlab-self-hosted' or 'custom'
    "gitToken": "", // Please, write your git token (github, gitlab ot bitbucket) with permissions to create ssh keys here (write it with the format 'token <access_token>' if it is github, 'Bearer <access_token>' if it's gitlab or bitbucket)
    "bitriseToken": "", // Please, write your bitrise token with permissions to create ssh keys here
    "bitriseOrganizationSlug": "", // Please, write your Bitrise organization slug
    "projectPath": "", // projectPath in case that you want to add the bitrise.yml file to your local repository. This param is in case that you run the script without running the bootstrap
    "projectName": "" // Project name to complete the bitrise.yml file with correct info. This param is in case that you run the script without running the bootstrap
```

To run only the bitrise script you have to run: `yo yourPathToWolmo/generators/bitrise/bitrise.js` you'll need [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/learning/index.html)
